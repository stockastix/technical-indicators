### Usage

```
stddev(^GSPC, 14)`
```

### Overview

Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. In trading, it is widely used to assess the volatility of a security’s price over a specified period. A higher standard deviation indicates greater price fluctuations, while a lower value suggests more stable prices.

### Formula

The standard deviation for a series of prices over `N` periods is calculated as:

```math
σ = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum{ (xi - μ)² }}{ N } }
```

Where:

- `σ` = standard deviation
- `xi` = each individual price
- `μ` = mean (average) price over the period
- `N` = number of periods

### Typical Use Cases

- **Volatility Measurement:** Identifying periods of high or low market volatility.
- **Bollinger Bands:** Used as a core component to define the width of the bands.
- **Risk Management:** Adjusting position sizes based on recent volatility.
- **Breakout Detection:** Spotting potential price breakouts after periods of low volatility.

### Examples

- Calculating the 20-day standard deviation of closing prices to determine current market volatility.
- Using standard deviation to set the width of Bollinger Bands around a moving average.

### Limitations

- **Lagging Indicator:** Standard deviation is based on historical prices and may not predict future volatility.
- **Sensitivity to Outliers:** Large price spikes can disproportionately affect the value.
- **Does Not Indicate Direction:** It measures volatility, not whether the price will move up or down.
