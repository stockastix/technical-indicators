### Usage

`rsi(^GSPC, 14)`

### Overview

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and magnitude of price changes. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and helps traders identify overbought and oversold conditions, potential reversal points, and the overall strength of a trend.

### Formula

RSI is calculated using the formula:

```math
RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS}
```

Where:

- \( RS \) (Relative Strength) = Average Gain over \( n \) periods ÷ Average Loss over \( n \) periods
- \( n \): Typically set to 14 periods.

### Typical Uses

1. Overbought and Oversold Signals

   - **Overbought:** RSI > 70 (price correction likely)
   - **Oversold:** RSI < 30 (price rebound possible)

2. Trend Confirmation

   - RSI > 50 indicates an uptrend.
   - RSI < 50 indicates a downtrend.

3. Divergence Analysis

   - **Bullish Divergence:** RSI makes higher lows while price makes lower lows.
   - **Bearish Divergence:** RSI makes lower highs while price makes higher highs.

4. Failure Swings
   - A failure swing is when RSI breaks its previous high (bullish) or low (bearish) independent of price action.

## Examples

1. Overbought and Oversold Conditions

   - **Scenario:** Stock XYZ, currently trading at $150, has an RSI of 80.
     - Interpretation: The stock is in overbought territory and may face selling pressure soon.
   - **Scenario:** Forex pair EUR/USD has an RSI of 25.
     - Interpretation: The pair is in oversold territory, and a rebound might occur.

2. Bullish Divergence

   - **Example:** Gold prices make a new low at $1,850, but RSI forms a higher low, signaling waning bearish momentum.
     - Signal: Possible reversal to the upside.

3. Bearish Divergence
   - **Example:** Bitcoin’s price reaches $40,000, forming a higher high, but RSI forms a lower high.
     - Signal: Momentum is weakening, and a downward correction may follow.

## Advanced Strategies

### 1. RSI with Moving Averages

- Combine RSI with moving averages (e.g., 50-day SMA) to confirm trend direction.
  - **Example:** Use RSI to spot oversold conditions in an uptrend identified by the 50-day SMA.

### 2. RSI Breakout Trading

- Use RSI trendlines for breakout signals. Draw trendlines directly on the RSI indicator to spot momentum shifts.
  - **Example:** If RSI breaks above its downtrend line while price consolidates, it may signal an impending upward breakout.

### 3. Multi-Timeframe RSI Analysis

- Combine RSI readings from different timeframes (e.g., daily and hourly charts).
  - **Example:** If the RSI is oversold on the daily chart and shows a bullish divergence on the hourly chart, this may signal a strong buy opportunity.

### 4. Dynamic Overbought/Oversold Levels

- Adjust overbought/oversold thresholds based on volatility or trend strength:
  - Use RSI > 80 for overbought in strong trends.
  - Use RSI < 20 for oversold in strong trends.

### 5. RSI and Fibonacci Retracements

- Pair RSI with Fibonacci retracement levels to time entries during pullbacks in trends.
  - **Example:** Wait for RSI to exit oversold territory near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level in an uptrend.

### 6. RSI and Bollinger Bands

- Use RSI to confirm Bollinger Band breakout signals.
  - **Example:** If RSI exits oversold while the price breaks above the lower Bollinger Band, it suggests a reversal.

## Limitations

- RSI can generate false signals in choppy markets.
- Overbought/oversold conditions do not guarantee immediate reversals.
- Best used in combination with other indicators for confirmation.
